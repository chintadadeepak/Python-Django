# python is a popular prog language
# in terms of what?
# no of devs using, no of libraries it offer, 
# no of companies using, no of areas it's implemented
# python is a general purpose language, domains such as AI, ML, web-dev, GUI
# python is a interpreted which means compilation and execution at the time one after the other,
# object oriented --> classes and objects
# high level language --> humans can understand

# why should we learn a programming lang and code?
# if we want to perform a task with a machine, we need to instruct the machine first
# as machines can understand only binary, we can't instruct in binary
# so we need a language which was understood by both
# this where prog lang comes into play
# which will be compiled and run on hardware


# arithmetic operations
# + --> add
# - --> sub
# / --> float div --> which also gives you the decimal in quotient
# // --> floor div --> which gives the quotient without decimal
# * --> multi 
# ** --> power of
# % --> remainder
# if you include single quote wrap everything in double quote
# if you include double quote then do in reverse
# if are there, use backslash to skip the meaning of syntax
# print('deepak\'s "laptop"')
# /n is escape sequence character which mean new line
# in order to skip the escape sequence characters meaning use r --> stands for raw string
# raw string does not cares the syntax it's simply prints the string
print(r'c:\docs:\newton')

# variables and list
# variables are the containers which hold certain values, they can be mutable.
# python is weakly typed language so mentioning of datatype is not required.
# at the time of declaration assignment is mandatory, based on which type of the variable is determined.

# using list we can able to store different values of different type.
# we can also form nested lists.
# slicing - fetching certain elements from the list.
# if you do not specify the last index, length will be taken by default.
# in IDLE if you want the previous output, we can underscore to get the previous output.
# indexing --> 0 to n - 1
# reverse indexing starts from --> -1 to -n.
# methods upon list:
1. append() --> inserts element at the end.
2. insert(idx, ele)
3. remove(ele) --> removes the first occurence of the element.
4. pop(index) --> element at the corresponding index will be removed.
5. pop() --> last element will be removed
6. del() --> to delete multiple values involves slicing
7. extend() --> to insert multiple values pass multiple values in the list
8. elementary operations like min, max, sum, sort

# Tuple and Set
# Tuples are similar to lists, the only difference is tuples are immutable.
# indexing and slicing works
# set will store the unique values, does not follow the sequence in which elements are insrted.
# as set is implemented using hashing for efficient retrieval, it does not follow indexing.
# sets are mutable.

# setting path and help command
# using set path we can define the path to command line, but after every login we need to define.
# using environmental variables is a good idea
# using help command and corresponding concept works, direct help command followed by the classname as a argument also works.

# more on variables
# for getting the address of a variable, we can use id command.
# in python, we have data pool concept where if a value is already existed in the memory i.e in the data pool, then no memory allocated for the current variable. instead same address will be given the current variable.
# if a variable is no more used in the program, it'll be given to grabage collection by PVM.
# python does not supports final variables but we can specify the intention using all capital letters.

# datatypes
# 1. None --> absence of value
# 2. Numeric --> int, float, complex, boolean
# 3. list
# 4. tuple
# 5. set
# 6. string
# 7. range --> returns a range of values
# 8. dictionary --> uses key-value machanism.
# keys should be unique
# we can fetch the values using two ways
# 1. using get function which takes key as an argument.
# 2. passing key in the subscript
# we can get all keys and values using keys() and values()

# operators
# arithmetic operators --> +, -, /, //, %, *, **
# assignement operators --> =, += ,-=, *=, /=, //, %=, **=
# unary operator --> ~, -
# relational operators --> <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=
# bitwise operators --> &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
# logical operatos --> &&, ||, !

# Number system conversion
# decimal to binary --> bin()
# decimal to octal --> oct()
# decimal to hexadecimal --> hex()
# vice versa also possible using int(value, radix)

# ~ tilde sign makes complements the bits within the memory.
# In memory, negative numbers will be stored in the form of 2's complement of a positive number.

# python has rich libraries 
# firstly math module
# functions including ceil, floor, sqrt, pow, factorial

# passing arguments from the command line
# using argv function --> returns string in return

# print function takes into next line
# if we specify end = "" as the second arg the control kept in the sameline itself.


# patterns
l1 = ['a','b','c','d']
l2 = ['p','q','r']

for i in range(len(l1)):
    for j in range(i+1):
        print(l1[j], end=" ")
    
    for k in range(i, len(l2)):
        print(l2[k], end=" ")

    print()

break, continue, pass
break --> used to come forcibly from the loop
continue --> used to skip the statements after the continue statement.
pass --> if we don't have any statements inside the block, such as conditional statements, methods and even
in class as well

# pass inside the conditional statements
if True:
    pass

# pass inside the method
def fun():
    pass

# pass inside the class
class Human:
    pass

# arrays --> similar to list DS, but array stores similar datatype values.
# using array() of array lib, we need to pass two arg 
# 1. typecode --> type of the data 
# example, for integer --> i
# for char it's u --> unicode representation
# 2. list containing the values
# smallCase --> signed
# captialCase --> unsigned
# array class lot of methods including buffer_info()
# buffer_info() returns a tuple containing address and size of the array 
from array import array as arr
# vals = arr('u', ['a', 'e', 'i'])
# for ch in vals:
#     print(ch)

vals = arr('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(vals.buffer_info())
# newArr = arr(vals.typecode, (ele * ele for ele in vals)) 
# fetch value from vals and store in new array
# print(newArr.index(16))

# why numpy
# the array method of array class does not support the multi dimensional array
# hence we need to install a third party library called numpy
# from array import array as arr

import numpy as np
vals = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
print(vals)

# creating an array in different ways
# 1. using numpy array()
# arr = array([1, 2, 3, 4])
# 2. using linspace()
# we need to specify the start, stop and no of parititions we want to divide
# as we are dividing the range the values in the array will be float values
# start and end values are included
# arr = linspace(1, 15, 15)
# 3. using logspace()
# logspace also works similar to linspace() 
# but it deals with power of the specified values
# arr = logspace(1, 5, 5)
# 4. using arange()
# arange() is similar to range() function takes start, end and gap between the values
# arr = arange(1, 10, 2)
# 5. using ones()
# ones() will assign the float values of 1. of specified size
# if we specify explicitly int, it assing int values
# 6. using zeros()
# zeros() working similar to ones()

from numpy import *

arr = zeros((5, 4), int)

# copying an array using view() and copy()
from numpy import array
arr1 = array([1, 2, 3, 4])
# arr2 = arr1 # this step does not mean that we are copying, 
# instead creating a new reference to the same memory location
# copying of an array in python is done in 2 ways
# using view() --> shallow copy --> though different arrays created inside the memory
# one modification will impact the second array
# arr2 = arr1.view()
# arr2[0] = 5
# print(arr1, arr2)
# using copy() --> deep copy --> different memory locations
# one modification will not impact the other
arr2 = arr1.copy()
arr2[0] = 5
print(arr1, arr2)

# working with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
from numpy import *

# arr1 = arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
# arr2 = arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
# print(arr.dtype) # returns type of the elements
# print(arr.ndim) # returns the dimension of the array i.e 1D, 2D
# print(arr.size) # returns no of elements
# print(arr.shape) # returns the shape --> tuple contains rows, cols

# arr = arr.reshape(4, 3) # using reshape() we can convert a linear array
# to multi-dimensional array
# print("initial: ", arr)
# arr1 = arr1.reshape(3, 3)
# arr2 = 
# print("after reshape: ", arr)
# print(arr)
# using flatten() --> we can convert a multi-dimensional array to linear array
# arr = arr.flatten()
# print('after flatten', arr)
#print(arr)
# numpy has a inbuilt method of matrix class
# which will provide additional features of matrix
# such as matrix multiplication etc
# we can also pass the matrix in the form of string
# where the rows values should be seperated using semicolon
# m1 = matrix(arr1)
# m2 = matrix(arr2)
m1 = matrix('1 2; 3 4')
m2 = matrix('4 3; 2 1')
print(m1 * m2)

# functions --> block or suite of statements which will do perform a task or returns a value
# in python,we define a function using def keyword
# in python, normal variables and functions are differentiated using round brackets
# arguments --> values passed to a function as an input
# actual arguments and formal arguments
# formal arguments --> arguments passed to the function.
# actual arguments --> arguments which were the actual values passed from the called function
# these are 4 types:
# 1. positional --> order in which we have passed the arguments --> wrong order will leads to errors
# 2. keyword --> we specify the keyword at the time of passing
# 3. default --> If the user does not provide the value, it will be replaced with default value, otherwise if user passes then it will be overriden
# 4. variable length --> single variable handles multiple values 
# and that variable internally is a tuple.

# def greet(name, country):
#     print("hello {}, welcome to {} ".format(name, country))

# def person(name, age = 20):

# what if you want pass the keyword as well

# global keyword and globals function
# functions will give priority to the local values then global values
# global variables can accessible within the file

# it can be done using globals()
a = 10
# b = 20
# c = 30
# print(id(a))

# exceptions
# before exceptions
# errors are of three types:
# 1. compile time --> syntactical
# 2. logical --> compile and execution is fine, but the logic is wrong
# 3. runtime --> abnormal terminating of execution
# whenever an exception is occured, control comes out of the program
# rest of the statements will not be executed
# statements are of two types:
# 1. normal statements --> which does not lead to exception
# 2. critical statements --> these statements may lead to excpetion for different inputs
# we need to handle the exceptions using try and expect blocks
# a program may contains multiple critical statements
# so we need to define those except blocks for each
# or we can go with Exception class which is the super class
# of all exceptions
# multiple exceptions are handled using the multiple exceptions blocks
# finally block is executed regardless of the exception
# and is meant for closing the resources such as closing files, closing DB 
# connectivity, closing the network

except ZeroDivisionError as e:

# Threads
# Threads are the basic unit of process
# multithreading
# execution of multiple threads
# normal objects execute sequentially

# run() will be called when we call start()
# start() makes thread enter into the runnable state

# in order to make the main thread execute it's
# instructions after the job done of threads
# we can use join()
# join() ensures after joining of threads with main, it will execute its instructions

# file handling
# why files?
# during the processing of data, itwill be stored inside 
# the RAM
# but what if we want to store even after the turn-off of CPU
# that'a where files comes into picture for persistent storage

# we have open() to open a file and we need to specify two args
# 1. file path including the extension
# 2. mode --> either read or write mode
# read() will return all the contents of the file
# if you want to read a line then readline() works
# if pass any integer to readline() it will return those many characters
# f = open('code.txt', 'r')
# print(f.read())
# using write(), we can write text on to the file
# if we don't have a file specified in the write(), it will create
# automatically for you
# print(f.readline(5))

# write() will just overwrites the content 
# regardless of the previous content
# if you want to append the data, go with append mode
# nf = open('auto.txt' , 'a')
# nf.write('write over writes the data')
# nf.write('\nnewly appended')

# copying of content using a loop
# loops in files fetches each line at a time
# nf.write('it was created by python')
# print(nf.read())
# same works for image files as well
# but the mode was different
# i.e using binary mode, we can access the files
# for text files, we use charmode
# of = open('code.txt', 'r')
# for line in of:
#     nf.write(line)
# rb --> read binary
# wb --> write binary

# comments in python
# python only supports single-line comments
# python also comments multiple lines using triple quotes
# but it was specified for docs

# is python is compiled or interpreted?
# the answer is both
# during the execution of python code
# it was compiled to generate the bytecode
# then that bytecode will be interpreted using interpreter
# what is interpretation?
# executing program lines one after the other
# but why bytecode?
# the answer is to achieve portability and platform independence
# as devs, we develops the application and clients don't need the development kit
# the need only the runtime environment, which will be executed 
# regardless of the underlying hardware. It will be done using the bytecode

a = 5
b = 6

# first approach --> consumes extra variable
# using temp variable

# temp = a
# a = b
# b = temp
# print(a, b)

# second approach using addition --> may increases the number of bits while addition
# a = a + b
# b = a - b
# a = a - b
# print(a, b)

# third approach using xor --> most efficient way
# a = a ^ b
# b = a ^ b
# a = a ^ b
# print(a, b)

# fourth approach
# a,b = b,a
# print(a, b)
