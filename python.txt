# python is a popular prog language
# in terms of what?
# no of devs using, no of libraries it offer, 
# no of companies using, no of areas it's implemented
# python is a general purpose language, domains such as AI, ML, web-dev, GUI
# python is a interpreted which means compilation and execution at the time one after the other,
# object oriented --> classes and objects
# high level language --> humans can understand

# why should we learn a programming lang and code?
# if we want to perform a task with a machine, we need to instruct the machine first
# as machines can understand only binary, we can't instruct in binary
# so we need a language which was understood by both
# this where prog lang comes into play
# which will be compiled and run on hardware


# arithmetic operations
# + --> add
# - --> sub
# / --> float div --> which also gives you the decimal in quotient
# // --> floor div --> which gives the quotient without decimal
# * --> multi 
# ** --> power of
# % --> remainder
# if you include single quote wrap everything in double quote
# if you include double quote then do in reverse
# if are there, use backslash to skip the meaning of syntax
# print('deepak\'s "laptop"')
# /n is escape sequence character which mean new line
# in order to skip the escape sequence characters meaning use r --> stands for raw string
# raw string does not cares the syntax it's simply prints the string
print(r'c:\docs:\newton')
